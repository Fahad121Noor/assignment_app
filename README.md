JSONPlaceHolder API  Assignment

I've uses JSONPlaceHolder Api using Bloc State Management with Retry Package using Dio.

I've added CRUD operations to the app but as we know JSONPlaceHolderAPI is a fake api so we cannot update,add or delete anything on their server but the logic of all these 3 are there.

LongPress: Will show Delete Dialog
Click: Clicking on Post will display Update Dialog
+ Floating Button: Will display Add Post Dialog.

You can check the logic for Add,update and delete in HomeScreen where it's calling the responding apis.
